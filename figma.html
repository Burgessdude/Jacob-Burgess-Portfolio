            <h1>My Figma Projects</h1>

            <p>I have been using Figma, Adobe products and other design materials 
                for around 2 years. These designs show off a variety of projects 
                that I have worked on.</p>

                <p>For this project I was tasked with redesigning a website for the UVU
                    Information Systems and Technology Department. As part of this project
                    I did user research to determine what students would most like to see implemented
                    to help the website be more accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through various versions of the website including wireframes and a functional prototype
                    I learned how to conduct user research and implement it in a way to help users.

                </figure>
                <p>For this project I decided to create a prototype of a 
                    National Parks app. I chose to create different features such 
                    as a home screen, a map, a trails screen and a list of medals 
                    that a visitor had achieved by going on trails and seeing the 
                    national park.</p>
                <p>I also did a write up of this project on Medium where I go over 
                    all of the specific features of my design.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>This design was created as a mobile companion to a dice game. It has 
                    several features such as keeping scores, rolling dice digitally, and 
                    having a scoreboard screen. As part of this design I created it using 
                    a mobile, tablet and desktop design that keeps the same features.</p>
                <p>I also made a case study presentation of my design which you can find 
                    below. This goes over my design process and the different things I 
                    changed to make the design better over time.</p>

            <p>For one of my classes this semester, we were asked to pick a nonprofit 
                local organization and redesign their website for them. I found one 
                called Children and the Earth that seemed like a great organization 
                that needed a great website to go along with it. Over the course of 
                the semester we improved our designs and we finally ended with making 
                a mobile website that is completely prototyped with animations and menus 
                between pages. The link to the figma file is included below</p>
            <p></p>

            <h2>Feit Electric App</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="feitelectric.png" alt="Feit Electric Home Screen" class="center" width="100" height="100">
                <figcaption>Feit Electric Home Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
                <p>Another project that I worked on this semester was redesigning the 
                    Feit Electric App. This is an app that is designed to connect to 
                    smart devices in your home so that you can control them. The only 
                    issue is that the app doesn't like as high tech as the concept itself. 
                    For this reason I decided to step in and go through the process of 
                    creating moodboards, then sketches, then wireframes and finally 
                    surface comps that could be used on an actual application. I will 
                    include a figma file below.</p>

            <h2>AOL Mail App</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="AOLMAIL.png" alt="AOL Mail Inbox" class="center" width="100" height="100">
                <figcaption>AOL Mail Inbox Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
                <p>The final Figma project that I will touch on is the AOL Mail App 
                    redesign. This one was fun because AOL Mail has a very old interface 
                    that hasn't been updated in quite some time. Our project was to figure 
                    out things that made other email services nice and to implement some 
                    of those features while redesigning the UI. I decided to simplify lots 
                    of the things AOL was doing and only stick to basic blue colors. I 
                    thought the end result turned out pretty nicely and you can see it all below.</p>
