            <h1>My Figma Projects</h1>

            <p>I have been using Figma, Adobe products and other design materials for about a year now. I have loved learning how to become better and faster at using these materials to my advantage. In several of my classes I have taken this semester I was tasked with redesigning different applications or websites so that they could work better. Here are a few of those that I have redesigned and the Figma files for them.</p>
            
            <fieldset>
            <h2>Children and the Earth</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="MobileEvents.png" alt="Mobile Events Page" width="100" height="100">
                <figcaption>A Screen from Children and the Earth</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For one of my classes this semester, we were asked to pick a nonprofit local organization and redesign their website for them. I found one called Children and the Earth that seemed like a great organization that needed a great website to go along with it. Over the course of the semester we improved our designs and we finally ended with making a mobile website that is completely prototyped with animations and menus between pages. The link to the figma file is included below</p>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>
            </fieldset>
            <p></p>
            <fieldset>
            <h2>Feit Electric App</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="feitelectric.png" alt="Feit Electric Home Screen" width="100" height="100">
                <figcaption>Feit Electric Home Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
                <p>Another project that I worked on this semester was redesigning the Feit Electric App. This is an app that is designed to connect to smart devices in your home so that you can control them. The only issue is that the app doesn't like as high tech as the concept itself. For this reason I decided to step in and go through the process of creating moodboards, then sketches, then wireframes and finally surface comps that could be used on an actual application. I will include a figma file below.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/LXPakgT6IWQ7bPEE6eA68z/Electric-Surface-Comps?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=p54ZmyrNa8kzG87O-1">Figma Link</a>
            <p></p>
            </fieldset>
            <p></p>
            <fieldset>
            <h2>AOL Mail App</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="AOLMAIL.png" alt="AOL Mail Inbox" width="100" height="100">
                <figcaption>AOL Mail Inbox Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
                <p>The final Figma project that I will touch on is the AOL Mail App redesign. This one was fun because AOL Mail has a very old interface that hasn't been updated in quite some time. Our project was to figure out things that made other email services nice and to implement some of those features while redesigning the UI. I decided to simplify lots of the things AOL was doing and only stick to basic blue colors. I thought the end result turned out pretty nicely and you can see it all below.</p>
