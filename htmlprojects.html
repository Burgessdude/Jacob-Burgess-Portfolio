            <h1>My HTML Projects</h1>
            <p>This recent semester I took a class on HTML basics. Throughout the course of the class I was able to learn how to create a website with multiple pages, images, tables, videos, mp3 files and much more. Because of what I learned in that class I was also able to code this entire website that you are viewing now. On this page I just wanted to show off some of the things I learned throughout the course of that class about how to use HTML.</p>
            <fieldset>         
            <h2>Record Website</h2>

            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="records.png" alt="My Records Website" width="300" height="300">
                <figcaption>My Records Website Survey Page</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For my class we were each asked to come up with a website idea that we thought would be interesting. I'm a big fan of the new vinyl record trend so I decided to base it on why they are becoming popular again and how vinyl records work. Each week over the semester I learned new concepts to apply to the website until I had applied everything I had learned. This included using CSS for things such as hover states or affecting image sizes so they would be the same. The link below will take you to the finalized record website I created using HTML.</p>

            </fieldset>
            <p></p>
           <fieldset>
            <h2>Vacation Website</h2>
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="vacations.png" alt="Budget Vacations Website" width="300" height="300">
                <figcaption>Budget Vacations Destination Gallery Page</figcaption>
            </figure>
                <p>In addition to the record website I also created one for my capstone, which was based on a travel agency website. For that assignment I took on different color templates, as well as learned how to use fieldsets better. You can see this project at the link below.</p>
