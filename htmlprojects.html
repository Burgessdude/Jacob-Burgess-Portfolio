      <h1>My HTML Projects</h1>

      <p>
        This recent semester I took a class on HTML basics. Throughout the
        course of the class I was able to learn how to create a website with
        multiple pages, images, tables, videos, mp3 files and much more. Because
        of what I learned in that class I was also able to code this entire
        website that you are viewing now. On this page I just wanted to show off
        some of the things I learned throughout the course of that class about
        how to use HTML.

        <div>
          <h2>Record Website</h2>
          <p>
            For my class we were each asked to come up with a website idea that
            we thought would be interesting. I'm a big fan of the new vinyl
            record trend so I decided to base it on why they are becoming
            popular again and how vinyl records work. Each week over the
            semester I learned new concepts to apply to the website until I had
            applied everything I had learned. This included using CSS for things
            such as hover states or affecting image sizes so they would be the
            same. The link below will take you to the finalized record website I
            created using HTML.

          <p>
            In addition to the record website I also created one for my
            capstone, which was based on a travel agency website. For that
            assignment I took on different color templates, as well as learned
            how to use fieldsets better. You can see this project at the link
            below.
