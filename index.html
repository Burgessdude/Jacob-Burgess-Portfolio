          I have been using Figma, Adobe products and other design materials for
          around 3 years. These designs show off a variety of projects that I
          have worked on.

          <h2>Arches National Park App</h2>
          <p>
            For this project I decided to create a prototype of a National Parks
            app. I chose to create different features such as a home screen, a
            map, a trails screen and a list of medals that a visitor had
            achieved by going on trails and seeing the national park.

            I also did a write up of this project on Medium where I go over all
            of the specific features of my design.

          <h2>UVU IS&T Website Redesign</h2>

          <p>
            For this project I was tasked with redesigning a website for the UVU
            Information Systems and Technology Department. As part of this
            project I did user research to determine what students would most
            like to see implemented to help the website be more accessible.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Through various versions of the website including wireframes and a
            functional prototype I learned how to conduct user research and
            implement it in a way to help users.

            This design was created as a mobile companion to a dice game. It has
            several features such as keeping scores, rolling dice digitally, and
            having a scoreboard screen. As part of this design I created it
            using a mobile, tablet and desktop design that keeps the same
            features.

            I also made a case study presentation of my design which you can
            find below. This goes over my design process and the different
            things I changed to make the design better over time.

          <h2>Children and the Earth</h2>
          <p>
            For one of my classes this semester, we were asked to pick a
            nonprofit local organization and redesign their website for them. I
            found one called Children and the Earth that seemed like a great
            organization that needed a great website to go along with it. Over
            the course of the semester we improved our designs and we finally
            ended with making a mobile website that is completely prototyped
            with animations and menus between pages. The link to the figma file
            is included below

          <h2>Feit Electric App</h2>
          <p>
            Another project that I worked on this semester was redesigning the
            Feit Electric App. This is an app that is designed to connect to
            smart devices in your home so that you can control them. The only
            issue is that the app doesn't like as high tech as the concept
            itself. For this reason I decided to step in and go through the
            process of creating moodboards, then sketches, then wireframes and
            finally surface comps that could be used on an actual application. I
            will include a figma file below.

          <h2>AOL Mail App</h2>
          <p>
            The final Figma project that I will touch on is the AOL Mail App
            redesign. This one was fun because AOL Mail has a very old interface
            that hasn't been updated in quite some time. Our project was to
            figure out things that made other email services nice and to
            implement some of those features while redesigning the UI. I decided
            to simplify lots of the things AOL was doing and only stick to basic
            blue colors. I thought the end result turned out pretty nicely and
            you can see it all below.
