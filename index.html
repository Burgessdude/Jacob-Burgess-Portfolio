            <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! I designed this 
                website as a way to showcase different designs and projects that 
                I have worked on as well as a biography to get to know me better. 
                Enjoy!</p>
            
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jacob Burgess and I am currently a student at Utah 
                Valley University studying Web Design and Development with an 
                emphasis in interaction and design. I have been in school for 
                almost three years and have loved getting to learn how to design 
                web pages so far.</p>
           
            <h2>Things I love</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I love spending time with my dog Sulley (from Monsters Inc.) 
                        I have had him since April and it has been a great learning 
                        experience for me.</li>
                    <li>I love building legos! I have built legos since I was a little 
                        kid and I love how creative I get to be with it. I think the 
                        reason I like website design a lot is because I get to be creative 
                        with it, a lot like how it is when I build legos. </li>
                    <li>Movies! I love movies a lot. I think the stories they tell are 
                        really fun to explore and learn more about. Overall I just love 
                        good stories, whether that's through books, movies or other types 
                        of media.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Goals for the future</h2>
                <p>I am looking forward to designing UX for people in creative ways. 
                    I like helping people a lot, and I feel like doing website design 
                    will help people navigate through websites easier so that they can 
                    enjoy the time they spend on a website more. Overall I am just excited 
                    to learn more things and make better websites.</p>
